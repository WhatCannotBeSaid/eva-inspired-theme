        /* Round 40 (2026-10-09) — why this function writes only what differs.
           Round 39 wrote every attribute and the artwork on every pass, and an
           innerHTML assignment is not a value assignment in the DOM: it removes the
           button's old children and inserts new ones, which is a childList mutation.
           childList is exactly what the observer below watches, and attributeFilter
           cannot cover it -- a filter only narrows the records of the class it is
           given. So the pass that React's own render scheduled fed itself: observer ->
           schedule() -> paint() -> decorate() -> childList -> observer, a microtask
           chain with no exit and no way for the task queue to run. From outside that is
           a renderer pinned at one core with no allocation growth and no error, and a
           start-up frozen on 「Loading plugins」. The scheduled flag cannot break it: it
           is cleared at the top of the very microtask the MutationObserver callback is
           queued into, so it only ever rejects re-entry within one pass, never across
           two.
           Writing only what differs ends the chain on its second pass -- nothing
           changes, nothing mutates, nothing schedules. Measured in Chromium against the
           round-39 shape: 2000 decorate passes in 32 ms before anything could stop it,
           versus 2 passes and 1 write when idempotent.
           firstElementChild is in the guard so a button whose contents someone else
           clears is still repainted -- the same self-healing the childList watch exists
           for (see the round-39 note above). Whether the button is on is still the

                 Where it goes decides the SEAM, not just the affordance. The first

                 all three are then siblings under one flex gap, and the 15px that
                 spaces the official pair spaces the pin too. The official pair keeps its
                 own spacing either way; the pair as a whole shifts left by one button
